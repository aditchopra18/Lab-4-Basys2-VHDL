# Lab-4-Basys2-VHDL
## Project Question
Q: Make a working 24 Hour Clock using the Basys 2 board in VHDL. Declare the entities and architecture used in the code. Use the 7 segment displays on the Basys 2 board to display the time in a "Hour Hour Minute Minute" format. For the seconds part, using 6 adjacent LEDs, blink them in a binary fashion torepresent its decimal equivalent.\
Also, program two buttons which are to be used for the following purposes respectively:
1) Resetting the clock back to 0000 hours
2) Speeding up the clock by changing the clock frequency to 200 Hz.
